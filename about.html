## About

I'm a second year Computer Science and  Accend student at UC interested in Artificial Intelligence and Cyber-Security. I am currently the Treasurer for ACM@UC, and enjoy working with the ACM to bring together the Computing community on campus. In addition to the social and professional events I help organize with the ACM, I am a member of the UC Robotics team, where I enjoy learning about robotics, and contributing to UC’s yearly competitive entry into the Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition.  I also am an organizer for RevolutionUC, Cincinnati’s largest hackathon, where I will be moving into a new role this year as Financial Lead for the event.
